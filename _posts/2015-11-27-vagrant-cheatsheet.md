excerpt: Here is a cheatsheet on Vagrant, using Virtualbox VMs. Covers basic commands and a few example setup and provisioning files.

Since this is a nice place to publish cheatsheets, like the earlier [Jade cheatsheet](/cheatsheets/jade-cheatsheet.html), and then the [web performance](/cheatsheets/performance.html) cheatsheet, I think I should continue the practice. 

In that spirit, here's my [Vagrant cheatsheet](/cheatsheets/vagrant.html), admittedly simple, since I'm not very experienced using it. I mostly did stuff using Virtualbox, since it's cross-platform and non-commercial software, and I feel like it's therefore a de facto standard for VMs. 

Feel free to offer advice or feedback, since the example files may not be working for you. This came from watching a tutorial online, and doing examples setting up and provisioning _ubuntu_ boxes running _nginx_ and _mongodb_ and using _puppet_. There's a couple _Vagrantfile_ examples, a couple _provision.sh_ examples and a couple _puppet_ manifests.
