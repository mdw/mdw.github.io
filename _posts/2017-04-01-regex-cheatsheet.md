excerpt: I like regex and I use this a lot in my work. Here is a quick and dirty cheatsheet for regex!
---

I like regex and I use this a lot in my work. Unfortunately there are variations in the different implementations, but they always seem to be minor in nature. At work, for example, we're typically faced with regular expressions that will be parsed more than once and therefore need double escaping.

So first of all, the __[RegEx Cheatsheet](/cheatsheets/regex-cheatsheet.html)__ I do plan to revisit this and add examples soon, but for now I'll just post it and see.
